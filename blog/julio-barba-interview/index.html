            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Julio Barba, a developer who works on video and image
              compression technology, focusing on the AV1 format and its
              successor, AV2. I started in backend development but pivoted to
              multimedia compression in 2023 by contributing to popular
              open-source AV1 projects like <a
                href="https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/"
                target="_blank"
              >libaom</a> and <a
                href="https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/"
                target="_blank"
              >SVT-AV1</a>. I'm now also a contributor to AV2, the
              next-generation video standard from the <a
                href="https://aomedia.org"
                target="_blank"
              >Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia)</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How did you get involved in multimedia compression?</h2>
            <p>
              At 10 years old, I discovered MP3s and Winamp and was amazed that
              you could shrink CD music by 10x with very little quality loss.
              That sparked my curiosity in compression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after, I learned about the royalty-free Ogg Vorbis audio
              format, which was even better than MP3. That led me down a rabbit
              hole of royalty-free video formats like Theora, VP9, and
              eventually AV1. In 2023, I started contributing to AV1 myself,
              focusing on improving its video and image quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, I teamed up with Gianni Rosato and two friends to create
              <a href="https://svt-av1-psy.com">SVT-AV1-PSY</a>, a version of
              the SVT-AV1 encoder focused on making videos look as good as
              possible to the human eye. We've since contributed many of our
              improvements back to the main SVT-AV1 project, making it more
              flexible, higher quality, and easier to use.
            </p>
            <h2>What is your role at Google?</h2>
            <p>
              I work with Google's image compression team on a feature called
              tune IQ, a brand-new mode in the libaom encoder designed for still
              images. It improves quality and consistency by intelligently
              directing more data to the parts of an image our eyes notice most,
              which means you get smaller files for the same visual quality.
              Tune IQ also includes a new detector that dramatically improves
              compression for content like screenshots, simple graphics, and
              animations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, tune IQ is already being used by customers like <em>The
                Guardian</em>, and we've received great feedback! We're now
              working to make it the default setting for creating AVIF images
              and help it become widely adopted.
            </p>
            <h2>How did you become part of the AV2 development effort?</h2>
            <p>
              My work with Google's image team was a natural entry point to
              contributing to AV2's image compression capabilities. Since Google
              is a founding member of AOMedia, it was easy to get involved. That
              said, the project is open source, so anyone can contribute, not
              just members!
            </p>
            <h2>
              We have WebP (from VP8), HEIC (from HEVC), and AVIF (from AV1).
              Will there be an image format based on AV2?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Given AV2's compression gains over AV1, I strongly believe the
              industry will want an image format based on it. There's already
              work being done to add support for AVM (AV2's reference software)
              into libavif, which is a popular library for handling AVIF images.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What AV2 features are you most excited about for still image
              compression?
            </h2>
            <p>
              I'm very excited about features like user-defined Quantization
              Matrices (QMs). This unlocks some powerful applications, most
              notably the ability to convert JPEG images into the AV2 format
              without the additional quality loss that normally happens when you
              transcode between formats. On top of that, you can apply
              deblocking filters to these converted images to smooth out
              artifacts and improve their perceived quality even more.
            </p>
            <p>
              AV2 also uses higher precision math for standard 8-bit content.
              This helps prevent "banding" -- those ugly, visible steps in what
              should be a smooth color gradient -- which can be caused by
              rounding errors during compression.
            </p>
            <h2>
              H.264 helped enable HD video on the web, while formats like AV1
              drove 4K and HDR. What new experiences might AV2 unlock?
            </h2>
            <p>
              That's a great question! There's a growing demand for high-quality
              Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) experiences,
              driven by products like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest. These
              applications require streaming video at very high resolutions (4K
              or higher), with a wide field of view (up to 360 degrees), and
              often with multiple views (e.g., one for each eye). AV2 is being
              designed with new compression tools specifically to handle this
              kind of demanding video more efficiently.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What adoption challenges do you foresee for AV2, and how can they
              be solved?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The main challenges will be the same ones every new codec faces:
              ensuring cheap, widespread hardware support and developing fast,
              efficient software for encoding and decoding. For AV2 to succeed,
              the entire ecosystem -- from chip manufacturers to codec
              developers and streaming services -- needs to work together.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be growing pains, but if we learn from the AV1 rollout,
              we can speed things up. Developing a very fast software decoder
              early on (like dav1d was for AV1) and optimizing the software
              encoders will be key to driving adoption.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Can you speculate on a timeline for widespread AV2 deployment?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It's hard to say for sure since the AV2 standard is still under
              development. However, seeing the close collaboration between all
              the AOMedia partners, I think the rollout could be even faster
              than AV1's. I wouldn't be surprised to see the first devices with
              AV2 hardware support by 2027. An optimistic guess for widespread
              deployment would be around 2030.
            </p>
            <h2>
              How do you see video and image compression evolving in the next 5
              to 10 years?
            </h2>
            <p>
              I'm betting we'll see a lot more machine learning (ML) and neural
              networks (NN) used in codec design. This could mean using AI to
              clean up and enhance the final decoded image, or it could mean
              building ML-based techniques directly into the compression process
              to improve quality from the start. I know of several research
              efforts already underway, and I hope to see them become part of
              real products in the future.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What are your thoughts on machine learning in future compression
              standards?
            </h2>
            <p>
              As I said, I believe ML will become essential. I expect it to be
              adopted gradually -- first by using ML to create smarter filters
              that clean up compression artifacts, and then expanding to other
              parts of the codec as device performance allows.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ultimate "holy grail" would be a codec that uses machine
              learning extensively in every step of the process. We might even
              see codecs that are essentially a single, large neural network.
              Companies like Deep Render have shown this is possible; we just
              need to make them fast enough to run in real-time on affordable,
              everyday hardware.
            </p>
            <h2>
              If you could instantly solve one problem in compression, what
              would it be?
            </h2>
            <p>
              My dream is to perfect the way we handle film grain in videos. I'd
              want to create a fully automated system that can intelligently
              preserve or synthesize film grain to match the director's creative
              intent, without needing manual tweaking for every single movie. To
              do that, we'd also need to develop a new quality metric that can
              actually understand and measure the visual appeal of film grain.
            </p>
