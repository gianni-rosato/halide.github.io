              Introducing Iris for WebP

              Today we're excited to announce the Iris project, our in-house
              image encoder. We've begun work on Iris's first codec, Iris-WebP:
              A WebP encoder that brings impressive gains over the reference
              encoder.
            </p>

                <img
                  src="/static/img/sky.avif"
                  width="1536"

            <h2>
              Why WebP?
            </h2>
            <p>
              WebP was introduced in 2010 with the goal of providing better
              compression for Web images. While it claimed to offer significant
              efficiency advantages over JPEG, in practice this wasn't always
              true. Its adoption was also slow due to an initial lack of
              widespread browser support and further lackluster support outside
              of the Web ecosystem. This led to WebP being perceived as a
              confusing addition to the Web.
            </p>

            <p>
              Desipte its reputation and unclear benefits, WebP has gained
              significant traction on the Web. It is available in over 95% of
              Web browsers, and large digital asset management companies serve
              billions of WebP images every day.
            </p>

            <p>
              Iris-WebP provides a fast, efficient WebP encoder designed for the
              human eye. Images encoded with Iris-WebP look significantly better
              than those encoded with the reference WebP encoder, and Iris-WebP
              performance outclasses encoders for slower, newer Web-first
              formats like AVIF.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Our Encoder
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our primary goals building Iris-WebP are speed, compression
              efficiency, and consistency. We want to consistenty output
              high-quality results from our encoder quickly, and in doing so
              provide an implementation that delivers on WebP's initial quality
              promises without compromise.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to meet our goals, we've developed robust tooling to
              measure visual fidelity with SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli. Visual
              performance is paramount, and we work hard to ensure Iris-WebP
              isn't just overfit for metrics. Our featureset includes novel
              image compression tech designed through meticulous psychovisual
              research, allowing us to provide unrivaled performance.
            </p>

              workflow, visit the <a href="/iris/index.html"
              >Iris project page</a>. At the time of writing, we don't have
              metrics to share, but they will be coming soon to the Iris project
              page. We're excited to see how Iris can help make the web faster,
              lighter, and more beautiful!
