              Halide Compression was founded to address a core need that a vast
              quantity of Web companies face: Delivering high-quality images at
              scale is hard, and new compression tech should make it easier, but
              often doesn't. We develop solutions to this problem.

          Our Goal
        </h1>
        <p>
          In short, we want to be your one-stop shop for image compression
          consulting and services. Companies like us already exist for video;
          video compression is expensive, and has garnered a rich ecosystem
          around its needs. There are a significant number of integrators who
          will help video businesses scale, offering cloud encoding solutions,
          high-quality licensed encoders, and more. Images often don't see the
          same love.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Halide Compression, our aim is to provide industry-leading products
          and expert consulting services to help companies where images matter.
          We want to play a significant role in powering a modern image
          compression ecosystem in order to help us all collectively move away
          from legacy standards. Newer image standards paired with top-tier
          implementations provide a faster, lighter, and more beautiful Web.
